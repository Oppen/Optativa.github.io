    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The idea of this site is to give talks/lectures about random stuff 
        we're researching or learning, etc. Not necessarily about only computer science
        topics but it's best if so. </p>
    <p>Talks duration should be at least 15 minutes to maximum one hour, if many people want to expose
        really short topics (less than 10') we can put many of them on a single date kind of like lightning talks.
    </p>

    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>Talk name (link to pdf/website etc). Expositor name. <b>Date</b></p>
