<h1>About</h1>
<div class='small_separator'></div>
The idea of this site is to give talks/lectures about random stuff we're
researching or learning, etc. Not necessarily about only computer science
topics but it's best if so.

Talks duration should be at least 15 minutes to maximum half an hour,
if many people want to expose really short topics (less than 10') we can
put many of them on a single date kind of like lightning talks.

Example:
Talk name (link to pdf/website etc). Expositor name. <b>Date</b>
